    make_raster_mask

Create a raster mask of the overall region under study

Note the different layout between the raster geographial representation and the underlying matrix data:

```
Matrix:      Raster:
1 5          1 2 3 4
2 6    ==>   5 6 7 8
3 7
4 8
```

So, when you take raster[2,1] you are taking the raster x=2 (from left), y=1(from top), that is 2 in this example.
